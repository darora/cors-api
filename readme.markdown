National University of Singapore Unofficial CORS API
====================================================

Placeholder readme - this readme will be updated with proper documentation once the project is done.

This is an unofficial CORS API. It consists of a Scrapy scraper project and a Flask webapp. The Flask webapp exposes a RESTful API.

Work-in-progress notes:
-----------------------
The scraper takes about 18 minutes to run while on the NUS network.
This project runs on MongoDB
The scraper deletes everything in MongoDB before beginning a scrape job. #tofix
